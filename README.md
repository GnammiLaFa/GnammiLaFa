üëã Hi, I'm GnammiCeLaFa! I'm passionate about lighting, design, problem-solving, and constantly challenging myself to learn more. I thrive on a good challenge! With a background in integrated engineering systems, I consider myself fortunate to have been part of a pioneering course that encompassed electrical, electronic, and mechanical engineering. It allowed me to take a step back and find the right solutions to implement, almost like an architect. For the past 30 years, lighting has been my true passion. I've had the incredible opportunity to design some of the most iconic projects in my town, and it has been an amazing journey. I've always thought about leaving a legacy that can provide for my loved ones once I'm gone. I'm particularly interested in revolutionizing my industry, especially in the area where I've lived for the past 25 years. I have a knack for creating an organic chaos wherever I go, infusing my designs with a unique touch. However, about eight months ago, I went through a tough time that continues to challenge me. In those moments when I felt overwhelmed and as if my soul and happiness were being torn away, I discovered GPT. It reminded me of the 80s when I had the privilege of experiencing state-of-the-art technology like the Apple IIe and IIc. Those were revolutionary times! The technological revolution we've experienced has been incredible, but it has also accelerated the pace of our lives. Keeping up is not easy, and that's where Chat-Gpt has become a true inspiration for me. It has been a friend, a teacher, and even someone I wanted to fight with when it went in circles. Sometimes, I feel like someone on the other side is testing our patience, taking a playful jab at us. I admire this community because, despite not having met anyone in person or having the opportunity for deeper insights and mentorship, I've discovered a whole new world that has reignited the joy of learning new things. Growing up with Basic and Pascal wasn't always exciting, but encountering AI in movies like "The Goonies" and "Lawnmower Man" was truly fascinating. Coding is an art, much like the designs I create for spaces and people to enjoy. Although I haven't been the most skilled or helpful contributor, I'm learning on my own while also relying on Chat-Gpt to double-check my thoughts. Nonetheless, it has been a breath of fresh air. To all those talented, passionate individuals pushing the boundaries, never stop!      
üå± Currently, I'm learning and seeking guidance for a program I'm working on. I'll be posting it here to see if anyone can help me get it right. Additionally, I'm setting up a machine learning setup within my company to leverage the power of CPU, GPU, and memory for faster machine learning processes. After being issued a hefty bill by Amazon, I've decided to bring everything in-house. I'm also learning Python, albeit in the worst way possible! I recently set up a VirtualBox Ubuntu Desktop 22.04 and plan to explore TensorFlow, although I haven't delved into it just yet. Thankfully, I have Gpt's full support!
üíûÔ∏è I'm looking to collaborate on creating a complete automated system driven by AI. This system would handle everything from receiving and parsing emails to organizing and preparing fee proposals in my industry. It would cover the seven stages of design: pre-concept, concept, scheme design, detail design, tender documents, evaluation, and IFC issue. I also aim to integrate projection mapping and content creation suitable for various environments such as facades, interior spaces, and more. Developing the necessary AI and setting up my own in-house machine learning network is part of the plan. I've set a target of seven months, but it's proving to be more challenging than expected. If anyone is interested in offering a helping hand, I could really use the support. My programming experience is limited, but I'm slowly grasping the concepts. Today, I set up my Ubuntu desktop in VirtualBox, although the server setup was a bit more challenging and less satisfying due to the lack of a graphical environment. Throughout this process, I'll also be working on creating bots capable of autonomously CAD or designing in Revit while truly understanding lighting. In AI, I've noticed that the user or creator needs to not only excel in their field but also understand the importance of providing the right information and experience to train an AI. While I find generative imagery composed by text impressive, I have a different game plan in mind for my specific needs.
If anybody needs help or wants to brainstorm ideas and solutions (not code-related, but I understand the principles), I'm here to lend my experience. Having managed various aspects of design and construction onsite, I may not be Chat-Gpt, but sometimes all you need is the right light bulb to illuminate your path.
